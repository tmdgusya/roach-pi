# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ROACH PI! This document outlines the process.

## 🚨 Before Adding a Feature — Start a Discussion

**All feature proposals must be discussed on GitHub Discussions before implementation.**

1. Open a new discussion in the [Ideas](https://github.com/tmdgusya/roach-pi/discussions/new?category=Ideas) category
2. Describe the feature, its motivation, and expected behavior
3. Wait for feedback before writing any code

This prevents wasted effort on features that may conflict with the existing architecture, duplicate planned work, or fall outside the project's scope.

Pull requests that add features without a prior discussion will not be reviewed.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports can be filed directly as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tmdgusya/roach-pi/issues/new). Please include:

- **Reproduction steps** — what you did, what you expected, what happened
- **Environment** — pi version, Node.js version, OS
- **Logs or screenshots** — if applicable

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmdgusya/roach-pi.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd extensions/agentic-harness
   npm install
   ```
3. Type `/reload` in the `pi` terminal to apply changes.

## Testing

```bash
cd extensions/agentic-harness
npm test
```

All changes must pass existing tests. New features should include new tests.

## Code Style

- Follow the patterns established in the existing codebase
- Keep changes minimal and surgical — see the Karpathy Rules built into this extension
- No premature abstraction or future-proofing
- Match existing naming conventions

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure there is a corresponding approved discussion for feature work
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Keep the PR focused — one concern per PR
